      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.

         <h2>Here is what the PoWH Developers don't want you to know, and why it could make you rich.</h2>
         
        <p>In cryptocurrency, a new idea comes along every few months and energizes the entire industry. The most recent injection of enthusiasm came sweeping in a few
        weeks ago in the form of Proof of Weak Hands. On the surface, it's a satirical game that plays on dead scam platforms, fueled
        by memes and crypto-themed jokes.</p>
        
        <p>In truth, there is not much else to the platform. No use case to speak of, simply buy and
        (weak hands) sell in order to collect dividends off other people's money. It's a zero-sum model. There is no interest bloat
        like you saw in lending platforms, and in theory the system can never shut down. Price ratcheting causes the entire model
        to scale up and down proportionally.</p>
        
        <p>It is simply a living, breathing smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. However,
        underneath all the jokes, it introduced a new economic model to the cryptocurrency world; a frictionless liquidity market.</p>

        <h2>FLM Verticals</h2>
        
        <p>Hold on, what is a frictionless liquidity market (FLM)?</p>
        
        <p>Vertical economies (or markets, depending on your definition)
        are economies that offer a specialized service for a specific purpose or consumer. Examples would be health care, real estate,
        even the jewelry industry.</p> 
        
        <p>It’s an important distinction to make over traditional centralized economies, because vertical
        economies can exist in troves and all of them be successful simultaneously while maintaining their own arbitrary ledgers
        of account on a blockchain. Because they are specialized and cater to specific markets, there can be hundreds or thousands
        of them working and co-existing with the digital space.</p>
        
        <p>Friction in a market is any cost or restraint associated with the
        transactions that occur within a given market that prevents a price from changing. If you buy Bitcoin on an exchange, you
        have to pay a fee in order to transact with that exchange. This is a form of friction that is imposed upon a market by an
        external party: a middle man taking their cut. Friction can also be part of the bid and ask protocol found in traditional
        markets; Price manipulation can occur with a relatively small amount of funds causing disproportionate damage to the market.</p>

        <p>A frictionless liquidity market is theoretically impossible, as there will always be some sort of fee associated with any
        transaction. However, with blockchain technology, it becomes possible to change the rules by which the funds flow, and who
        the middle man is. Exchanges have begun experimenting with this model, providing tokens to which a portion of the fees are
        paid, but are still offering bid/ask protocol markets only.</p>
        
        <p>With price ratcheting found in this new economic model, every
        output is proportionate to its input. This injects fairness into the market in the form of trading robot with unlimited supply
        and a price that scales with demand, destroying the conventional rules of supply and demand by ensuring the price is driven
        off a zero-sum equation: The more demand there is, the more supply becomes available, and the more each individual token
        is worth.</p>
        
        <p>This is literally backwards from traditional inflation models, and yet it remains perfectly fair because investors
        are compelled by both the speculation and the rules of buying into the economy. We’ve seen one enter the market. A niche,
        satirical vertical economy. But the potential for the framework to be innovated further is boundless. The possible ramifications
        could alter the landscape of the future beyond what we can even imagine. And there is one team that is trying to do just
        that.</p>
